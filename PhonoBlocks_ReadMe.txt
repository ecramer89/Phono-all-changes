Starting up PhonoBlocks:


To use with the tangible letters:

-plug the USB into the laptop

-open Unity

-it should open up on the scene file called "main menu". (check the name of the scene on the frame of the window). 
If it opens on a different scene (or no  scene):
go to the drop down "file" menu on the unity editor and follow this path:

   file-->open scene--> (folder)Phonoblocks--> main menu

-run the application. click on the arrow that is at the top of the unity editor (or press ctrl p).

-two icons: teacher (teacher) and student mode (laptop). Student mode has activities.

-teacher mode:
   place arduino letters to add them to the letter bar.
   tap the flag to reveal the hidden menu
   double tap the affix button to reveal the affix menu
   (tapping either a second time hides the corresponding menu).
   tap an affix to add it to the letters in the letter bar (*you cannot add an affix unless there is at least one letter in the letterbar)
   tap the "check" button to add the current word to the history. 
   double tap the words in the history to show their letter and play their recording (if they have one)

-student mode:
   choose activity types (e influence vowel or consonant le)
   click the laptop icon to begin
   begin by placing tangible letters that match the screen letters in the same places as the screen letters.
   when you've placed all the letters the system will provide you the main activity instructions.
   try to build the word; atm the system won't allow you to place letters in positions that aren't meant to be changed at all (i.e., the fifth through seventh positions 
   when building the word "fade").
   when you're satisfied, press the check button to submit your answer.
   if you're correct, system will add the word to history and tell you to remove the letters
   if incorrect, system will offer a hint and show the hint button.
   press hint button to hear the hint
   pressing the check word button again will reveal a new hint (if your answer is incorrect again); press hint button again to hear the new hint.


-system will cycle through as many problems as you provided (when it runs out it will show a blank screen. it will repeat problems if you request more unique problems than
I've programmed in. currently there are 2 consonant le and 2 e influence vowel problems)


note: the arduino takes a few moments to connect with unity. if you have placed letters before starting the application, it will take a few seconds before they light up.
